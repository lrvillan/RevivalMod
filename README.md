## Overview
RevivalMod adds a second-chance mechanic to Single Player Tarkov. Instead of immediately dying when taking lethal damage, you'll enter a critical state and can use a defibrillator to revive yourself and continue your raid.

## Features
- **Critical State System**: Enter a weakened state instead of dying immediately
- **Defibrillator Revival**: Press F5 while in critical state to revive using your defibrillator
- **Post-Revival Protection**: Temporary invulnerability period after revival to get to safety
- **AI Behavior Modification**: Bots ignore players in critical state
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear notifications and visual effects for critical state and revival
- **Balance Features**: Movement limitations during critical state and cooldown between revivals

## Requirements
- SPT (Latest version)
- BepInEx

## Installation
1. Download the latest release ZIP from the Releases section
2. Extract the contents to your SPT installation directory
3. The mod will be automatically loaded when you start the game

## How To Use
1. **Preparation**: Make sure you have a defibrillator (ID: 60540bddd93c884912009818) in your inventory
2. **Critical State**: When you would normally die, you'll enter critical state instead
3. **Revival**: Press F5 to use your defibrillator while in critical state
4. **Recovery**: After revival, you'll have temporary invulnerability but reduced movement speed
5. **Cooldown**: There's a 3-minute cooldown between uses of the revival system

## Configuration
You can modify the following settings in the `Constants.cs` file:

```csharp
// Change which item works as a revival tool
public const string ITEM_ID = "60540bddd93c884912009818"; // Default: Defibrillator

// Set to true for testing without requiring the actual item
public const bool TESTING = false;

// Enable/disable self-revival
public const bool SELF_REVIVAL = true;
```

Additional settings in `Features.cs`:
- `INVULNERABILITY_DURATION`: Duration of post-revival invulnerability (default: 4 seconds)
- `MANUAL_REVIVAL_KEY`: Key to trigger revival (default: F5)
- `REVIVAL_COOLDOWN`: Time between revivals (default: 180 seconds)

## Known Issues
- Visual effects may occasionally flicker or not display properly
- Some interactions between revival state and certain game mechanics may cause unexpected behavior

## Troubleshooting
- **Revival not working**: Ensure you have a defibrillator in your inventory
- **Still dying instantly**: Check logs for errors and make sure the mod is properly installed
- **Performance issues**: The mod has minimal performance impact, but disable if experiencing problems
